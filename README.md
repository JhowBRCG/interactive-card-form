# Interactive card details form

## About the project

This is a solution to the [Interactive card details form](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-card-details-form-XpS8cKZDWw).

The main challenge is to create a form that the user will be able to fill in the inputs and see in real time the changes occurring on the images of the credit card.

That is not all. There are also validations in case the user fills in the inputs in an incorrect way. If that happens, a message will render "saying" what the user must type on that input.
